We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
016 023
2
I am standing there
On a balcony in summer air
016 027
3
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
032 041
1
Little did I know
043 046
2
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
048 055
2
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please don't go
055 062
3
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
062 072
2
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
072 081
3
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
084 094
1
Escape this town for a little while
095 098
2
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
100 108
2
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go
